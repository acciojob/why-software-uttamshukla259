	<h1>Why I want to become a developer</h1>
	<p>
		I have always been interested in technology and the endless possibilities it offers. I love the idea of creating something from scratch and seeing it come to life through code. As a software developer, I would have the opportunity to be creative and solve complex problems, while also making a positive impact on people's lives. I am passionate about using technology to create efficient and innovative solutions that can improve people's daily lives. I am also motivated by the constantly evolving nature of the tech industry, as there is always something new to learn and explore. Ultimately, I believe that being a software developer will allow me to combine my passion for technology with my desire to make a difference in the world.
